File Name:  ChuckNorrisModel2K4.rar

Software Used:  DXTBmp, GIMP 2.6.11, UnrealEd 3.0 and Classic Notepad


Description
-----------
Chuck Norris is ready to fight his sensitive style at the Unreal Tournament
2004!  Probably due to the fact that most younger players don't really know
who Chuck Norris is.  This model is came from the 1993 TV action/crime drama
series "Walker, Texas Ranger".  It includes some 4-team skin support but the
texture of his style is very kinda strange, completing his biography and
modified his statistics, and there are no bugs known.  H0rs3 created this
model, not me if possible.

The pack does not include the voice pack of Chuck Norris.  I have no time to
make his voice pack but it should have been created by next year.  Hope you
enjoy.  :)

"Violence is my last option." --Chuck Norris
